### Welcome!
I'm Danielle David aka ellechaotech and I am a baby software engineer with foundations in java; currently learning react.js.
I'm very interested in working with projects that make the web more accessible for the disabled, or
projects that use computer vision but I am open to anything that will allow me to learn more. 

My website is DanielleDavid.com and my blog is elle0elle.dev (with a zero between the two elles).
